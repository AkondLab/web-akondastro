Data processing and databases for the Aruacaria Project. 

The project focuses on improving the calibration of the cosmic distance scale in the local Universe.  
Researchers trace down how environmental factors affect the brightness of various standard candles by comparing distances to their host galaxies and clusters, using different measurement methods.
