Together with the Araucaria Project team, 
we are developing the OCM Observatory software platform. 

Telescope automation, modern observatory GUI, data processing pipelines and machine learning tools are the components which
make **OCM** a powerful tool for astronomical research.

The universal platform is designed to be used by both professional astronomers and amateur enthusiasts in various facilities around the world.
